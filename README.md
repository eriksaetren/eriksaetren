<h1>Erik Saetren, aka SixTricks</h1>
<hr>
Hi there, and welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹ 
I've been obsessed with coding for the last ten years, and have countless projects under my belt at this point. 
I haven't been great at uploading my projects here, but I'm trying to get better ðŸ˜‡
Recently I've been primarily focused on:
<ul>
<li>Custom WordPress development</li>
<li>PHP scripting and OOP</li>
<li>Pixel Art</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
