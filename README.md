Hi there, and welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹ 
I've been obsessed with coding for the last ten years, and have countless projects under my belt at this point. 
I haven't been great at uploading my projects here, but I'm trying to get better ðŸ˜‡
<br><br>
Recently I've been primarily focused on:
<ul>
<li>Angular + PrimeNg development</li>
<li>dApp development</li>
<li>Blockchain technology</li>
<li>Pixel Art</li>
<li>Web & UX design</li>
<li>JS / TS</li>
</ul>
